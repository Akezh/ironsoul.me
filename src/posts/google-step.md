## About

There are quite many resources on how you get Software Engineering Internship in Google and that is cool. However, only few of them are covering Google STEP internships.

I was lucky enough to get an offer for Google STEP internship and I will try to share my experience.

This article is created specifically for Google STEP and consequently, the major audience is high-school students and 1,2-year students from universities (colleges). _Some of the tips and tricks may not apply to other companies or other roles in Google._

I would recommend you reading [this](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/) before diving further. Let's begin.

## Applying

The process is fully identical to applying for simple SWE internship. You either apply with a referral from a Google employee or you simply apply through a website. It is **highly** recommended to apply with a referral. I had another opinion about this back to September of 2019 but as of now, I am sure that the referral **significantly** increases your chance of getting an interview. As always, in order to apply, you need to have a resume. Let's talk about it a bit more.

## Resume

I have a lot of friends with a competitive programming background. An interesting fact is that most of the people who get an internship in Google STEP are people who did a lot of olympiads at school. One of the key secrets is that **_Google recruiters accept resumes of people who are really likely to pass technical interviews_**. They try to keep as many little candidates as possible but the success rate of candidates on interviews are high. What does it mean for you? 

In your resume, you should convince a recruiter that you are good enough at solving problems. For example, have a look at [my resume](https://ironsoul.me/STEP.pdf) for the moment I have applied to Google. Note that I have placed *Achievements / ACM recognitions* section at the top of [my resume](https://ironsoul.me/STEP.pdf) because I understood that they are really important. My friends who also got interviews had similar sections where they listed their achievements in olympiads. So if you did competitive programming at school and had some achievements, that is what you definitely want to put on your resume. 

But not all of us did competitive programming. It does not mean that you are not good enough or you do not have a chance to get an interview. I know a bunch of people who never did it before but their resumes were accepted and they were called for interviews. However, these people had other cool things in their CV like internships and different awards. Anyway, if you did not do competitive programming, you should start doing it now. Start participating in ACM ICPC, Google Code Jam, Codeforces, etc. Listing your achievements in these competitions are really valuable.

I think you got the point.

## Wheel of fortune

Even if you are a great candidate, there is always a factor of *randomness*. There are a lot of people from my university who are much *smarter* than me. They have more achievements in olympiads but they were not called for an interview.

You should be ready for such cases. When you apply for an internship position, you apply for a roulette game where thousands of students experience their luck. Please understand it and do not blame yourself if recruiters do not get back to you. The fact that I got a response does not mean that I am better than people who did not hear back. I just got lucky and tomorrow this might not work. At the same time, _do not think you should not try_. Even if you have zero background in computer science and you are majoring in Political Science, you can still apply since there are no limitations.

## Interview

As a rule, interviews for Google STEP internship are simpler than for a simple SWE internship. I guess this rule works in 85-90% of the cases. However, there can be some exceptions. In my first interview, I got a leetcode hard problem and I have struggled a lot with it. The interviewee tried to guide me and look at my thinking process. What I want to say is that if you are qualified for an interview, be ready to get some relatively non-easy problem. Study hard and solve problems thinking that you prepare for an SWE interview. If you do so, you will be good enough to crack it.

If you are a strong competitive programmer, it does not mean you can ignore the preparation for interviews part. Again, I know some people who are excellent at solving problems but they failed interviews because of other factors such as bad mental preparation. Never stop learning and please, sleep as appropriate before your interview. My friend Akezhan also suggests drinking a coffee before doing interviews since it will boost your energy for a short time.

## Misconceptions

Do not think that you can not get an internship in Google because you never did anything related to Computer Science before. Just start solving Leetcode problems and get familiar with C++. After solving 50 problems, you will start to understand that it is **not that hard**. 

I and a couple of my friends also thought that girls have a higher chance to be reached out by recruiters. My experience proved it to be wrong so do not think about it.

## Last words

I hope you picked up something new.

I have a couple of good friends who also got offers for STEP internship. If you are such a person or you just want to share your knowledge, please consider contributing to this article on [GitHub](https://github.com/ironsoul0/ironsoul.me/blob/master/src/posts/google-step.md).

Thanks for reading! I wish you to achieve everything you want.
