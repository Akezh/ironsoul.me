My mom once told me that I have to read more. And then I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOZpDg6Oj0) of John Fish where he says that he read 100 books in 100 weeks. Crazy boy. This is how I decided to give it a try.

## Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future

I guess everyone says that this is the must-read book for anyone who wants to do business. Probably, yes. I read about 30% of it and get bored. When I was ~16, I forced myself to read boring books but now there is a feeling that I can choose whatever really interests me. So I just returned this book to the library.

## Animal Farm

This one was recommended to me by my little sister Aruzhan. She is only 12 y. o. and I sometimes wonder how she can read such literature.

You read the book and draw parallels between the farm and the Soviet Union. Pretty interesting to read. Especially the end.

## The perks of being a wallflower

This one was recommended to me by my friend Akezhan when we spoke about books in our dorm room. 

I read about 40% of it and so far the book is interesting. Just interesting, it is not amazing or mind-blowing. Sometimes I feel the same things as the main hero and that makes me think a lot about my life.

I feel a bit upset that this book was written by the person who was ~30 years old at the moment of writing. Is this really possible to describe feelings of 15 y. o. boy when you are 30? I do not know but I hope yes.

I am really about to end this book but I do not have a feeling that I got the idea or message of the author. Overall, the story is very interesting and it was pretty joyful to get through all this journey with Charlie but I am a bit worried that I did not get the message. But who knows, maybe there is no message at all or I hope I will catch it when I will make it to the end.

Finally completed reading this book. I reread the end three times and it feels **tough** because it still feels like I do not get the idea.

There are really heartwarming moments like when Bill said that Charlie is _"one of the most gifted people I've ever known"_ or when Charlie and his friends _"feel infinite"_ while riding through the tunnel. The entire story is great but I think that I did not get some points. 

For example, I did not really get the idea of _"doing things"_ mentioned by Sam and her statement that _"you're not even there sometimes"_.

Anyway, I would be happy if you read this book and let us have a discussion about it. Once you read it, you will know how I chose the next book to read.

## To Kill a Mockingbird

**17.02.2020** 

F*cking hard to read. Tried to understand the first two pages but no luck. I am not ready for such complex novels.

## The Alchemist

**17.02.2020**

My classmates are saying we read this one on our literature class but I guess I did not. Hope it is not late yet.
