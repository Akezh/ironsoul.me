My mom once told me that I have to read more. And then I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOZpDg6Oj0) of John Fish where he says that he read 100 books in 100 weeks. Crazy boy. This is how I decided to give it a try.

## Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future

I guess everyone says that this is the must-read book for anyone who wants to do business. Probably, yes. I read about 30% of it and get bored. When I was ~16, I forced myself to read boring books but now there is a feeling that I can choose whatever really interests me. So I just returned this book to the library.

## Animal Farm

This one was recommended to me by my little sister Aruzhan. She is only 12 y. o. and I sometimes wonder how she can read such literature.

You read the book and draw parallels between the farm and the Soviet Union. Pretty interesting to read. Especially the end.

## The perks of being a wallflower

This one was recommended to me by my friend Akezhan when we spoke about books in our dorm room. 

I read about 40% of it and so far the book is interesting. Just interesting, it is not amazing or mind-blowing. Sometimes I feel the same things as the main hero and that makes me think a lot about my life.

I thought like I would write in more interesting way but that's it for now ðŸ˜‚
