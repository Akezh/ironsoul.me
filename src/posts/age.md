I caught myself on thinking on this almost every day. 

The fact that I am getting older means that my carefree life slowly goes to its end. I am starting to understand that time that was before is impossible to return. Sometimes I am regretting on things I did when I was 16 - 17. Did I do the right things? Was it right to spend almost all my time studying something? Yes, it was very interesting but now I feel that probably I lost some opportunities that I could only have when I was younger. Probably I could spend more time with my friends and close ones but I did not do it. The pain is that you never know whether you did the right things or not. You decide on your own and I am doubting whether I spent my time the right way. I was constantly looking for people's praise and feeling like I became addicted to this. 

I am soon turning 20 and I guess it would be fair to name this date very depressing for me. When you are 20, you are no longer a child. You should behave differently and people's expectations are much different. I am scared to turn 20. Looking at how people achieve phenomenal success before getting 20 creates additional pressure. I am truly happy for these people and they motivate me a lot but the fact that I did not achieve the same is killing me. 

I am more and more starting to think that I am just wasting my youth. Moreover, I already wasted most of it... I just do not know whether I spent it the right way and no one knows. I should just decide on my own and probably this put pressure on me.

The right way to describe my feelings is to say that I am never sure whether I am currently doing the right things for my future or not. Even when I develop myself as an IT engineer that probably will be helpful for my career, I am not sure whether I want to do this in future or not. It is very interesting right now and I am obsessed to it but there will be much higher pressure when you become older and you could no longer let yourself just to "learn" things that you like. You will be forced to do something that brings you money and does not necessarily mean you will like what you do. 

It is very hard to describe what I feel and I do know why I am writing this. Probably, because I am thinking about this almost all fucking day and I want to share it with someone. Sharing such things on Instagram seems ridiculous to me and that's why I am sharing it here.

Take care <3
